in sync replicas

what happens if out of sync

write req -> load into segment -> batch -> write to s3 -> send ack to producer

---

read path:

spin up a consumer
subscribe to a topic

if new consumer and consumers already exist:
stop all consumers.
re-assign consumers to topic-parts.
(stop the world rebalance)

eager vs incremental?

---

join a consumer group
    we need to notify the consumer group of _our_ id/ip?
    all nodes will then register this
    triggers a rebalance?

poll a consumer group
    given a consumer local id?
    only one node serves this request.
    check consumer group contains requesting consumer
        see what stuff it's assigned to
        batch some messages and respond them if available

assign a partition -- leader performs this
    i am a consumer with this id
    leader
        notify all other consumers to stop (how?)
        assign partitions to all known consumers
        notify all consumers to pick up there respective partitions
